# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects implemented as part of my college course. Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook with the implementation and analysis of different machine learning algorithms on predefined datasets from kaggle. Below is the list of projects along with the corresponding datasets used.

The notebooks cover a wide range of machine learning techniques, including:

- **Regression Analysis**: Implementation of simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and binomial logistic regression.
- **Classification Algorithms**: Application of various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA.
- **Clustering and Factorization**: Matrix factorization techniques.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Implementation of ensemble techniques including Max Voting, Averaging, Weighted Averaging, Bagging, Random Forest, and AdaBoost.
- **Manual Implementations**: Custom implementations of KNN, classification metrics, and regression metrics.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Computing and comparing the accuracy and performance of different models.
